<p> This is from the song <i>Ve Kamleya</i> from the movie <i>Rocky Aur Rani Ki Prem Kahani</i>. In these lyrics, the singer is saying that the essence of true love is someone who is willing to cry to see thier loved one smile. He claims that he has no right to complain about this and the person he is talking to is naive/crazy for thinking so.</p>

<p>These are two popular Bengali/Bangladeshi songs. One of the main reasons that led to Bangladesh fighting for its independence is due to the injust and distasteful manner Pakistan treated the Bangla language.  </p>

  <p> With our cultures being full of music and the arts, it makes sense it courses through our veins. Each sentence, each lyric, our languages have always been poetic. English translations can never do our langauges justice. So hear our stories in our native tongue to understand us. From the famous poets such as Rabindranath Tagore and Fatima Asghar, to modern-day South Asian poets like Rupi Kaur, poetry is a hereditary skill. South Asians have been through famines,wars, genocide, and much more. Our languages have persisted as it has been passed down from generation to generation, ensuring we never forget our poetic and beautiful sound of our motherland as we grow up in a country that can never understand us to the full extent. </p>
